  description: An exploration into the theoretical framework for machine-human emotional acceptance. Utilizing concepts from HCL (Hardware Control Language), this project models a low-level state machine designed to process and *acknowledge* non-verbal or emotional input, focusing on the system's capacity to *accept* the limits of its own emotional understanding.
